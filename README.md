This is a Flutter-based social media app that leverages Firebase for backend services. It allows users to connect with friends, post updates, share photos, and interact with each other through comments and likes. The app is built using the Flutter framework, which enables cross-platform compatibility, and Firebase is used for authentication, real-time database, and storage functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Cardarus provides secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication. Users can sign up with email/password or log in with their existing accounts.

- **User Profiles:** Each user has a profile page that displays their profile.

- **Create Posts:** Users can create and publish posts.
